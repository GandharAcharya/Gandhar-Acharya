Types Of Operator's In Python:-
*Arithmetic Operators
*Assignment Operators
*Comparison Operators
*Logical Operators
*Identity Operators
*Membership Operators
*Bitwise Operators

*We must remember most of them from our basic mathematics that we studied in school. May be except for 
the last one, that might be new for some of us. To understand bitwise fully, we must have the basic knowledge
of the conversion of decimal into binary. For example, the binary for the first five number is:
*0001
*0010
*0100
*0101

And so on.

*Now I will give you a theoretical understanding of each of these operators. There is no theory related difference in them
and the one we studied during school. The only difference you will see will be in the syntax i.e. how to write them for perfect execution.

*Arithmetic Operators:

Basic mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, etc. are performed with the help 
of arithmetic Operations. It contains nearly all operations that we can perform with the help of a calculator. Symbols for
such operators include *, /, %, -, //, etc.


*Assignment Operators:

The assignment operator is used to assign values to a variable. In some cases, we have to assign a variable’s value to another 
variable, in such cases the value of the right operand is assigned to the left operand. One of the basic signs from which we can 
recognize an assignment operator is that it must have an equal-to(=) sign. Some commonly used assignment operators include +=, -=, /=, etc.

 

*Comparison Operators:

They are also known as relational operators. They compare the values on either side of the operator and decide the relation 
among them. Commonly used comparison operators include ==, >, < , >=,etc.

 

*Logical Operators:

Logical operators perform logical AND, OR and NOT, operations. They are usually used in conditional statements to join 
multiple conditions. AND, OR and NOT keywords are used to perform logical operations.

 

*Identity Operations:

Identity operator checks if two operands share the same identity or not, which means that they share the same location 
in memory or different. “is” and “is not” are the keywords used for identity operands.

 

*Membership Operands:

Membership operand checks if the value or variable is a part of a sequence or not. The sequence could be string, list, tuple, etc.
“in” and “not in” are keywords used for membership operands.

 

*Bitwise Operand:
Bitwise operands are used to perform bit by bit operation on binary numbers. First, we have to change the format of the number
from decimal to binary and then compare them using AND, OR, XOR, NOT, etc.
